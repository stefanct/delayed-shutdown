delayed-shutdown
----------------

Initscript that delays the shutdown procedure as long as a predefined
lockfile (no-shutdown lockfile) exists. The no-shutdown lockfile should be set
whenever a running process, for instance a backup script, should not be
interrupted by a system shutdown or reboot. When started, this script has no
impact on system performance.


Manual Installation:

As user 'root' follow the instructions to install the file in your initscripts
directory:

  cp delayed-shutdown /etc/init.d/
  chmod +x /etc/init.d/delayed-shutdown

For RedHat and relatives run:

  chkconfig --add delayed-shutdown

For Debian and relatives run:

  update-rc.d delayed-shutdown defaults


Manual De-installation:

If for any reason you need to remove 'delayed-shutdown' from your system do
the following:

For RedHat and relatives run:

  chkconfig --del delayed-shutdown

For Debian and relatives run:

  update-rc.d -f delayed-shutdown remove

Delete the initscript:

  rm /etc/init.d/delayed-shutdown


Usage:

In order to delay the shutdown process until your software finishes its
operation, you should create the no-shutdown lock file:

         /var/lock/noshutdown.lock

Then let your software do its job and, when finished, delete the no-shutdown
lock file. In case of a script that would be:

     lockfile /var/lock/noshutdown.lock
     ... [script is working] ...
     rm -f /var/lock/noshutdown.lock

See the included example script 'test.sh'.
